Creating, editing, and accessing SQLite databases from within R
---------------------------------------------------------------

This repository contains R code and data that accompanies tutorials available at ... . The tutorials appear in four parts: *R and SQLite Part 1* through to *R and SQLite Part 4*; corresponding to the four R files numbered *01* through to *04*. 

The code might not appear exactly as it appeared in the tutorials.  The code here has more annotations than the corresponding code in the tutorials. 

The code uses the R packages: `RSQLite`^1, `DBI`^2 and `sqldf`^3 for database functionality; and the `XLConnect`^4 package to read Excel files.
