Creating, editing, and accessing SQLite databases from within R
---------------------------------------------------------------

This repository contains R code and data that accompanies tutorials available at [R and SQLite Part 1](http://sandymuspratt.blogspot.com.au/2012/11/r-and-sqlite-part-1.html), ... . The tutorials appear in four parts: *R and SQLite Part 1* through to *R and SQLite Part 4*; corresponding to the four R files numbered *01* through to *04*. 

The R code is contained in the [R](https://github.com/SandyMuspratt/R-and-SQLite/tree/master/R) folder; the data files are contained in the [data](https://github.com/SandyMuspratt/R-and-SQLite/tree/master/data) folder

The code might not appear exactly as it appeared in the tutorials.  The code here has more annotations than the corresponding code in the tutorials.
