Creating, editing, and accessing SQLite databases from within R
---------------------------------------------------------------

This repository contains R code and data that accompanies tutorials available at http://www.something.com.au .
The tutorials appear in four parts: *R and SQLite Part 1* through to *R and SQLite Part 4*.

The code might not appear exactly as it appeared in the tutorials.  The code here has more annotations than the corresponding code in the tutorials.
